This is my README.md file within my /projects folder.

Sub-Folders Include:
    Personal-Portfolio-NoReact
        This portfolio project was created for graduation without using React as there was no need for using React or Redux.

    Personal-Projects
        This folder includes projects that have been started but aren't complete.  They are projects that I will be continually working on to complete and make better as I practice my new skills in web development.

    VSchool-Projects-Complete
        This folder includes all of the projects that were required to graduate from V School.  These projects are Minimum Viable Product as I completed my schooling.  I am using this as a baseline to show my increased knowledge and abilities as I get better in this new career.
