This is my README.md file within my /projects folder.

Sub-Folders Include:

    Personal-Projects
        This folder includes the following:
            freedom-cars-vets
                This is a personal project that I am working on for a family member who restores and donates classic cars for our veterans.  This is an ongoing project that I am continually working on and tweaking.
                
            my-memories
                This is a personal project for myself.  My goal is to create a family app that family members can share their stories, use for family history, videos, pictures and family recipes. My hope is to include using the familysearch.org API.  This is an ongoing project that I am continually working on and tweaking.
                
            personal-portfolio-noReact
                This is the final project with school that is to showcase my resume, skills, and development projects that I have worked on to share with future employers.  I didn't need to use React or Redux for this portfolio.

            showcase-skills-portfolio
                This is created for potential employers to see the different assignments that I completed for my schooling.  These are very simple and basic examples of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React and Redux.  Most of my React and Redux can be found in my VSchool-Completed-Projects (rock-the-vote and my-pantry-project-react).
                        

    VSchool-Completed-Projects
        This folder includes all of the projects that were required to graduate from V School.  These projects are MVP (Minimum Viable Product) as I completed my schooling.  I am using this as a baseline to show my increased knowledge and abilities.  The pantry project is on-going.
