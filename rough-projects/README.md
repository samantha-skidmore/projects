This is my /projects/rough-projects folder.  These are projects that I have started but then I have put on hold for various reasons.  I started a few React/Redux sites which is why there is a separate folder for the archive-react-redux.  I still want to go back and figure something out with it.

I am using pieces of the business-time project for my business-homepage-react site which is also a work in progress.

Memories is something that I started as a bigger project but then made it smaller for the API project.  Unfortunately using the familysearch.org API was going to be more in-depth for the moment as I am trying to accomplish just something basic at the moment.  I love my idea though which I have wireframed out on paper.  I will elaborate further in another README later.
